# Component State, Event Handlers
- Start with a new example:
```javascript
const Hello = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    const name = "Peter";
    const age = 10;

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Greetings</h1>
            <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
            <Hello name={name} age={age} />
        </div>
    );
};
```


## Component Helper Functions
- Expand `Hello` component so it guesses the year of birth of person being greeted:
```javascript
const Hello = (props) => {
    const bornYear = () => {
        const yearNow = new Date().getFullYear();
        return yearNow - props.age;
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
            </p>
            <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
        </div>
    );
};
```
- Logic is in a separate function as you can see.
- Notice the function can directly access the `props` input.
- Notice also we define a function in a function, which is common in JS.
