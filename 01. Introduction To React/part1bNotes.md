# JavaScript
- Goal to learn JS.
- Name of JS standard is `ECMAScript`.
    - Latest is from June of 2021.
    - ECMAScript 2021 or ES12.
- Browsers don't support all of JS's new features.
    - Lot of code run in browsers have been transpiled from new version to old version of JS.
- Popular way of transpiling is using `Babel`.
    - Transpilation auto configured for apps created with `create-react-app`.
- `Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime environment.
    - Works anywhere from servers to mobile phones.
    - Practice writing JS using Node.
    - Expected that version of Node.js is at least 16.13.2.
    - Latest versions of Node already understand newest JS versions.
- Code written in files ending in `.js` and run using command: `node <name_of_file>.js`.
- Can write JS into Node.js console.
    - Opened by typing `node` in command line and dev tools.
