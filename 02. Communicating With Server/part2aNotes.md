## console.log
- Logging to the console is good practice!

## Protip: Visual Studio Code Snippets
- Can create `snippets` or shortcuts for generating reusable code quickly.
- Instructions are here: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_creating-your-own-snippets`
- Can also use readymade plugins.
- Most important is the `console.log()` snippet, `clog`.
```
{
    "console.log" {
        "prefix": "clog",
        "body": [
            "console.log('$1')"
        ],
        "description": "Log output to console"
    }
}
```
- VSCode has a built-in one.
    - Type `log` and press tab to autocomplete.
